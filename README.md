# NAD-Network-Applications-Development
A repository that contains assignments for my Network Applications Development (NAD) course in university.

There are 2 assignments:
1. A chat application built using Java Swing
2. An E-commerce website built using Spring MVC framework

Of course, those 2 assignments are only made for academic and learning purposes, they're **NOT** meant to be used for real world applications.
